const score = 100 // I have not told js that i am storing a number in score
const scoreValue = 100.3 // there is no float datatype this is number datatype only
const isLoggedIn = false
const outsideTemp = null
let userEmail;

const id = Symbol('123')
const anotherId = Symbol('123')
console.log(id === anotherId);

const bigNumber = 34567889034n // bigInt Example

const heros = ["shaktimaan", "naagraj", "doga"];// array example
let myObj ={

const myFunction = function(){

console.log(typeof id);
